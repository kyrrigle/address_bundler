# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
This project is a command line tool to process student portrait images and create print-ready PDF files using a configurable design template. 
The tool will allow users to input a batch of student portraits, apply a design template, and output high-quality PDFs suitable for printing class signs.
This tool will form the backend functionality for a bespoke paid service.   Schools (or PTOs) will be the customers.

## Features
- Validation of student portrait images for file reability and minimum resolution requirements
- Batch processing of student portrait images
- Images will be auto-cropped to fit the template specification.
- Image cropping will use facial recognition to keep the subject centered in the cropped image.
- Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Configurable design templates for layout and styling
- Templates will be PDF files with corresponding json metadata specifying slots to be filled (photo, name, year, etc)
- Output print-ready PDF files
- Command line interface with clear options and flags
- Error handling and logging for processing issues
- Support for custom fonts and colors in templates
- Support for multiple projects with the ability to switch between projects.
- Each project's resources should will be kept in a separate directory

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to create a new project
- As a user, I want to be able to configure a project to use a particular design template.
- As a user, I want to generate class signs quickly from student photos
- As a user, I want to be able to add new design templates for use.
- As a user, I want to process large batches of images efficiently to save time.
- As a user, I want to create a PDF "proof" which has multiple small images per page that can be delivered to the customer for review
- As a user, I want to be able to replace an image for a particular student
- As a user, I want to be able to create final deliverable PDF files.  These will have one sign per page, full resolution.  Configurable max number of pages per file.

## Technical Requirements
- Implemented in Python for cross-platform compatibility
- One command line entrypoint called `cs` which uses the docopt library for command line parsing
- Use of image processing libraries (e.g., Pillow)
- Use of PDF generation libraries (e.g., ReportLab)
- Configuration files for design templates (YAML or JSON)
- Unit tests for core functionality
- CLI argument parsing with docopt

## Constraints
- Must run on macOS and Linux environments
- Should handle at least 100 images per batch without performance degradation

## Future Enhancements
- GUI for template design and preview
